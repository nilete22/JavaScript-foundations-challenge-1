//1. At the start of the program print out: "--- Animal Checker Program ---"
console.log("--- Animal Checker Program ---");
//2. Create a variable called animal that starts at the value "cat"
var animal = "dog";
//3. Create an if statement that checks if animal is equal to "cat"
//4. If it is equal to "cat", print out "Meow!" to the screen
//5. If it is equal to "dog", print out "Woof!" to the screen
//6. If it is neither "cat" nor "dog", print out "Must be an alien"
if (animal === "cat") {
  console.log("Miau!");
} else if (animal === "dog") {
  console.log("buup!");
} else {
  console.log("it could be an alien");
}
//7. At the end of the program print out: "--- Animal check complete ---"
console.log("--- Animal check complete ---");
//8. Change animal to different values to make sure it works in all cases
