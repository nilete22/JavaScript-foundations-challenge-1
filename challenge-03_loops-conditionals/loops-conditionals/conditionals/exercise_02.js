/* 
  The declaration of the variables is not well executed, because in the code it is 
  executed that those who are that age or younger paint the result, but speaking of 
  a topic such as age, one can be over 18 years old.
  Example of the program update:

  const age = 20;

  if (age < 3) {
    console.log("You're just a baby!");
  } else if (age < 13) {
    console.log("You are in elementary school, kid.");
  } else if (age < 18) {
    console.log("Nice, you're a teenager!");
  } else {
    console.log("Most places consider you an adult.");
